# matcap-studio

An utility to tweak matcaps, with realtime visual feedback.

The main objective of this project is to have a free, fast and (relatively) simple way for developers and designers to tweak their matcaps while having a direct feedback.

## How to use

 - Drag and drop matcap files, png and jpg files are currently supported.
 - Drag and drop any model you want to specifically test the matcap on, obj, prwm and self-contained gltf/glb files are supported.
 - Press H to hide the GUI.
 - The output of the tool is currently limited to 512x512 png files.
